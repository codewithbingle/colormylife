- ðŸ”­ We are not here to compete, but to learn, evolve, enjoy the company and the team.

We have created the website [ColorMyLife](https://colormylife.netlify.app/). This is a website that allows you to create your art through your emotions. It uses art as a therapy tool to help you express them and improve your mental health. Having the opportunity to do so is a great way to stay healthy and happy. 

We have built this website using HTML5, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.<br>
  Process of Development:<br>
  1) We brainstorm during our meeting about the theme we wanted to make.<br>
  2) We divided the task among ourselves.<br>
  3) We meet up for another meeting to show progress of each one's assignments.<br>
  4) We tried to combine everything together and see if things are working as we expected.<br>
  5) Due to limited skills, we unfortunately able to execute what are UX Designer has orginally planned.<br>
  6) We decided to proceed and submitted what we have made and plan to improve it as our skills improve along with it.<br>
